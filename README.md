Background: Food waste is a common problem. In Switzerland, the average household throws away about 30 percent of still edible food. Creating a food plan and buying only food for what you want to cook may reduce the amount of wasted food drastically.  

The goal of Ingrid is to extract ingredients from recipes into a checklist in order to simplify the process of getting missing ingredients. The ultimate use case would be an integration of Ingrid to local food delivery services.
